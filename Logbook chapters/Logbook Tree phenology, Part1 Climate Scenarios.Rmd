This logbook will answer the Exercises of the module "Tree phenology analysis in R". It will start with chapter 3, ends with chapter 35 and will only shortly tell if a chapter is left out (like chapter 17).\
The logbook is split into the following 3 parts, Climate Scenarios (chapter 3-19), PLS regression (chapter 20-28) and the phenoFlex model (chapter 29-35).

This is part 1 about climate scenarios.

# Chapter 03 Tree dormancy

1.  Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods?\

    -   Because the cultivar is already released there should be official data about the cultivar. Therefore I would use these data to calculate the temperature requirements. As base data I need the long phenological data sets and temperature records. With these I can calculate finally the date of dormancy overcome.\

2.  Which are the advantages (name 2) of the BBCH scale compared with early scales?

    -   Growth stages are easily recognizable under field conditions.

    -   Growth stages are graded in the order of appearance.

3.  Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale.

    The pictures are described from left to right. All of the classifications are based on the given pictures and I assume that the image section shown corresponds to the most represented of the tree.

    -   Picture 1: BBCH-stage 03
        -   Main stage: 00: sprouting
        -   Stage 03: end of the bud swelling (leave buds), parts of the buds are light green, the bud scales are spread apart
    -   Picture 2: BBCH-stage 65
        -   Main stage 60: Flowering
        -   Stage 65: Full flowering, at least 50 % of the flowers are open, the first petals are already falling.
    -   Picture 3: BBCH-stage: 86
        -   Main stage 80: ripening or maturity
        -   Stage 85: Coloring advanced (The color is too light to be ripe but is clearly advanced).

# Chapter 04 Climate change and impact projection

1.  List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.
    -   Main drivers of climate change (influence from decade to century scale)
        -   Greenhouse gases
        -   Aerosols
        -   Clouds
        -   Surface albedo
        -   Ozone
        -   Sun
        -   Long-term drivers
    -   Currently most important for the climate are greenhouse gases and their increasing amount in the atmosphere
        -   The reason are mainly human activities like deforestation, fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes

        -   Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere

        -   Can absorb only radiation of certain wavelengths

        -   Short-wave radiation from Earth surface is absorbed
2.  Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.
    -   Recently the mean temperatures are globally rising clearly and very drastically

    -   Especially in the last 50 to 100 years

    -   This an other factors have a great influence in our climate and weather (regional and global)

    -   We will and already do experience more extreme weather (like more dry periods, extreme rain, especially mild and extreme winter)

    -   Most important is the rapid warming (as conclusion)
3.  What does the abbreviation 'RCP' stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?
    -   RCP -\> Representative Concentration Pathways

    -   RCPs project future greenhouse gas concentrations (NOT emissions) based on different climate change scenarios until the year 2100

    -   The different scenarios are labeled after the possible radioative forcing values in the year 2100
4.  Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.
    -   Statistical models
        -   Analyzes relationships between species occurrences and environmental factors to predict distributions. Often based on historical data.
        -   Does not account for ecological interactions or future adaptability.
    -   Species distribution modeling
        -   Uses species presence/absence data and environmental variables to estimate potential distributions under current and future climates.
        -   Assumes species are in equilibrium with their environment, which may hold under climate change.
    -   Process-based models.
        -   Simulate biological and ecological processes (e.g. metabolism, reproduction) to predict species and ecosystem responses.
        -   Requires extensive species-specific data and is computationally demanding.
    -   Climate analogue analysis
        -   Identifies regions where current conditions resemble projected future climates to predict potential species shifts.

        -   Does not consider non-climatic factors (e.g. land use, human impact) that influence species survival.

# Chapter 05 Winter chill projections

1.  Sketch out three data access and processing challenges that had to be overcome in order to produce chill projections with state-of-the-art methodology.
    -   Climate Data Acquisition
        -   Climate datasets come from multiple sources, such as meteorological stations, reanalysis datasets and climate models.
        -   Differences in spatial and temporal resolution require preprocessing to ensure consistency.
        -   Missing data and measurement errors need handling to avoid distortions in projections.
    -   Model Selection and Calibration
        -   Multiple winter chill models exist (e.g. Chill Hours, Utah Model, Dynamic Model) each responding differently to temperature variations.
        -   Choosing the most appropriate model for a specific region is crucial, as different tree species have varying chill requirements.
        -   Calibration is needed to align models with observed historical data and improve predictive accuracy.
    -   Uncertainty and Bias Correction
        -   Climate models often introduce biases that must be corrected before using their projections.

        -   Different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (e.g. RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) result in a range of possible future conditions, adding uncertainty.

        -   Statistical methods, such as ensemble modeling and probabilistic approaches, help quantify and communicate these uncertainties.
2.  Outline, in your understanding, the basic steps that are necessary to make such projections.
    1.  Data collection and Preprocessing

        -   Gather historical temperature records and future climate projections from global and regional sources.
        -   Standardize the data sets by converting them into compatible formats and resolutions.
        -   Fill in missing data and remove inconsistencies that could affect model accuracy.

    2.  Chill Model Application

        -   Apply a chosen winter chill model to calculate chill accumulation over time.
        -   Compare results from different models to understand their variability and sensitivity.
        -   Validate model outputs against historical observations to ensure reliability.

    3.  Climate Scenario Analysis

        -   Run chill models using projected temperature data under different climate change scenarios.
        -   Analyse how winter chill accumulation might shift in various regions over time.
        -   Compare results across different periods (e.g. near-future vs. late-century) to assess long-term trends.

    4.  Validation and Uncertainty Assessment

        -   Compare modeled projections with historical observations to evaluate accuracy.

        -   Apply statistical techniques to quantify uncertainties and assess model reliability.

        -   Use ensemble approaches to minimize errors and account for variability between models.

    5.  Visualization and Interpretation

        -   Present results using graphs, maps, and reports for easy interpretation.

        -   Provide insights for stakeholders, such as farmers and policymakers, to support decision-making.

        -   Communicate potential risks and adaptation strategies based on projected changes.

# Chapter 15 Future temperature scenarios

1.  Briefly describe the differences between the RCPs and the SSPs (you may have to follow some of the links provided above).

The main differences between RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) ans SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) are the following:

-   Focus

    -   RCPs are defined through greenhouse gas concentrations and radioactive forcing levels

    -   SSPs include socioeconomic factors (e.g. population growth, energy use, policy decisions) along with emissions pathways

-   Drivers of Change

    -   RCPs only consider atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and their effects on climate

    -   SSPs include also social, economic and technological factors that influence emissions

-   Policy Relevance

    -   RCPs provide no direct link to human actions or policy decisions

    -   SSPs offer insights into how different societal choices impact climate change

-   Emissions Pathway Representation

    -   RCPs directly define future greenhouse gas concentration levels

    -   SSPs can be paired with radioactive forcing levels for more flexibility

-   RCPs are considered now as outdated and SSPs are now mainly used
