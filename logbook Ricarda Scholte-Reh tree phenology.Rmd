# Tree dormancy

## Exercises

1.  Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods?\
    -   Because the cultivar is already released there should be official data about the cultivar. Therefore I would use these data to calculate the temperature requirements. As base data I need the long phenological data sets and temperature records. With these I can calculate finally the date of dormancy overcome.\
2.  Which are the advantages (name 2) of the BBCH scale compared with early scales?\
    -   Growth stages are easily recognizable under field conditions.\
    -   Growth stages are graded in the order of apperance.
3.  Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:\
    The pictures are described from left to right. All of the classifications are based on the given pictures and I assume that the image section shown corresponds to the most represented of the tree.\

-   picture 1: BBCH-stage 57\
    -   Main stage: 50, reproductive development or influence emergence\
    -   stage 57: Sepals open (59 would be ballooning, but the petals are too compact for this stage)\
-   picture 2: BBCH-stage 65\
    -   Main stage 60: Flowering\
    -   stage 65: Full flowering, at least 50 % of the flowers are open, the first petals are already falling.\
-   picture 3: BBCH-stage: 86\
    -   Main stage 80: ripening or maturity\
    -   stage 85: Coloring advanced (The color is too light to be ripe but is clearly advanced).\

# Climate change and impact projection

## Exercises

1.  List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.\

-   Sun
    -   Warms Earth through solar radiation
    -   Activity varies slightly (cyclically) over time, as evidenced by sunspots
    -   Differences in energy that reaches Earth are small
    -   Explains only a small fraction of current climate variability
    -   Important driver of climate change on geological timescales, but not of recent climate change
-   Aerosols
    -   Suspensions of liquid, solid, or mixed particles with highly variable chemical composition and size distribution
    -   Natural sources: Sea salt, dust, volcanic eruptions, fires
    -   Anthropogenic sources: combustion processes (e.g. power plants, cars, fires and cook stoves)
    -   Generally have a cooling effect on the climate, especially locally
    -   Human aerosol emissions are a major climate driver in some places
    -   Global aerosol distribution – fraction of Aerosol Optical Depth related to human emissions
    -   Major climate driver in industrial centers
-   Clouds
    -   Can have both cooling and warming effects
    -   Net effect likely important but poorly understood
    -   Positive feedback with warming possible: warmer -\> more clouds -\> warmer -\> more evaporation -\> more clouds
-   Ozone
    -   Surface (tropospheric) ozone: constituent of smog, health hazard (bad ozone)
    -   Stratospheric ozone (10-35 km above surface): shields Earth from UV-B radiation (good ozone)
    -   Greenhouse gas: presence in the stratosphere has a warming effect
    -   Destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
-   Surface albedo
    -   Reflection of radiation by the land surface
    -   Light surfaces (e.g. ice, snow) reflect almost all radiation, dark surfaces (ocean, dark soil, forest) very little
    -   Land cover change can affect albedo
-   Greenhouse gases
    -   Atmospheric gases that trap heat on Earth
    -   Can absorb only radiation of certain wavelengths
    -   Short-wave radiation from the sun passes
    -   Long-wave radiation from Earth surface is absorbed
    -   Greenhouse effects warms the planet
-   Long-term drivers
    -   Trends in solar activity
        -   Star life cycle, gradually decreasing luminosity over billions of years
    -   Ocean currents/continent constellations
        -   Global heat transfer (Gulf Stream, Antarctic Circumpolar Current; millions of years)
    -   Plants vs. animals (hypothetical)
        -   Balance of CO2 production and consumption
        -   Back and forth between ‘Snowball Earth’ and ‘Greenhouse Earth’
    -   Volcanic and meteorite activity
        -   Volcanoes emit CO2 (warming) and dust (cooling) ; supervolcanoes caused massive effects
        -   Meteorite impacts can raise dust concentrations for years
    -   Trends in solar activity
        -   Star life cycle, gradually decreasing luminosity over billions of years
    -   Ocean currents/continent constellations
        -   Global heat transfer (Gulf Stream, Antarctic Circumpolar Current; millions of years)
    -   Plants vs. animals (hypothetical)
        -   Balance of CO2 production and consumption
        -   Back and forth between ‘Snowball Earth’ and ‘Greenhouse Earth’
    -   Volcanic and meteorite activity
        -   Volcanoes emit CO2 (warming) and dust (cooling) ; supervolcanoes caused massive effects
        -   Meteorite impacts can raise dust concentrations for years
    -   Milankovic cycles
        -   Variation in Earth’s orbit: eccentricity, axial tilt and precession (19,000 to 400,000-year cycles)
        -   Most likely cause of Ice Ages

2.  Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.\

-   Recently the mean temperatures are globally rising clearly and very drastically
-   Especially in the last 50 to 100 years
-   this an other facors have a great influence in our climate and weather (regional and global)
-   we will and already do experience more extreme weather (like more dry periods, extreme rain, mild and extreme winter)
-   most important is the rapid warming (as conclusion)

3.  What does the abbreviation 'RCP' stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?\

-   RCP -\> Representative Concentration Pathways
-   RCPs project future greenhouse gas concentrations (NOT emissions) based on different climate change scenarios until the year 2100
-   the different scenarios are labeled after the possible radiative forcing values in the year 2100

4.  Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.\

-   statistical models
-   species distribution modeling
-   process-based models
-   climate analouge analysis

# Winter chill projections

## Exercises

1.  Sketch out three data access and processing challenges that had to be overcome in order to produce chill projections with state-of-the-art methodology.\
    -   three ways to view data

    -   difficulties with processing

    -   Chilling Hours Model

        -   not a good model
        -   especially for warm climates not trustable
        -   
2.  Outline, in your understanding, the basic steps that are necessary to make such projections.\
    -   Steps needed for todays projections
    -   

# Manual chill analysis

## Exercises

1.  Write a basic function that calculates warm hours (\>25° C).
Basis structure:
> # read in Dataset
> dataset[ , new_column_name] <- dataset$temperature_column > 25

2.  Apply this function to the Winters_hours_gaps dataset

```{r, echo = True, results = "hide"}
rm(list=ls()) # clears the environment from unwanted values etc.
library(chillR)
library(knitr)
library(pander)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
Winters_hours_gaps <- Winters_hours_gaps
hourtemps <- Winters_hours_gaps[ , c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Temp")]

hourtemps[ , "warm_hour"] <- hourtemps$Temp > 25

hourtemps[2503:2507, ]
```
3.  Extend this function, so that it can take start and end dates as inputs and sums up warm hours between these dates.

```{r}
Start_Date <- which(hourtemps$Year == 2008 &
                      hourtemps$Month == 6 &
                      hourtemps$Day == 1 &
                      hourtemps$Hour == 12)

End_date <- which(hourtemps$Year == 2008 &
                    hourtemps$Month == 6 &
                    hourtemps$Day == 30 &
                    hourtemps$Hour ==12)
sum(hourtemps$warm_hour[Start_Date:End_date])
# The result is 250 and will be the controll for the following function with the same start and end


sum_warmH <- function(WHourly, 
                        startYear,
                        startMonth,
                        startDay,                   
                        startHour,
                        endYear,
                        endMonth,
                        endDay,                   
                        endHour)
{WHourly[,"warm_hour2"] <- WHourly$Temp > 25
  Start_row <- which(hourtemps$Year == startYear &
                     hourtemps$Month == startMonth &
                     hourtemps$Day == startDay &
                     hourtemps$Hour == startHour)

  End_row <- which(hourtemps$Year == endYear &
                   hourtemps$Month == endMonth &
                   hourtemps$Day == endDay &
                   hourtemps$Hour == endHour)

WHs <- sum(WHourly$warm_hour[Start_row:End_row])
    
return(WHs)}

sum_warmH(hourtemps,
           startYear = 2008,
           startMonth = 6,
           startDay = 1,
           startHour = 12,
           endYear = 2008,
           endMonth = 6,
           endDay = 30,
           endHour = 12)
```


# Chill models

## Exercises

1. Run the "chilling()" function on the Winters_hours_gap dataset.
```{r}
hourtemps <- Winters_hours_gaps[ , c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Temp")]
?chilling

chilling_l7 <- chilling(make_JDay(hourtemps),
                   Start_JDay = 90,
                   End_JDay = 100)
chilling_l7
```

2. Create your own temperature-weighting chill model using the "step_model()" function.
3. Run this model on the Winters_hours_gap dataset using the "tempResponse()" function.

```{r}
df_l7 = data.frame(
  lower = c(-1000, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
  upper = c(    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1000),
  weight = c(   0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0))

step_model_l7 <- step_model(HourTemp=hourtemps$Temp, df=df_l7)

TResp_l7 <- tempResponse(make_JDay(hourtemps),
                         Start_JDay = 90,
                         End_JDay = 100,
                         models = list(Chill_Portions = Dynamic_Model,
                                       GDH = GDH))
TResp_l7
```
GDH = Growing Degree Days



# Making hourly temperatures

## Exercises

1. Choose a location of interest, find out its latitude and produce plots of daily sunrise, sunset and day length.
- location of interest: Dairy farm with own fodder cultivation (belongs to my uncle)
                        Bislich, 46487 Wesel
- coordinates: latitude: 51°40'58.4"N
               longitude: 6°29'46.4"E

```{r}
require(chillR)
require(ggplot2)
require(tidyr)

Days_l8 <- daylength(latitude = 51.4, JDay = 1:365)
Days_df_l8 <- data.frame(JDay = 1:365,
                         Sunrise = Days_l8$Sunrise,
                         Sunset = Days_l8$Sunset,
                         Daylength = Days_l8$Daylength)

Days_df_l8 <- pivot_longer(Days_df_l8, cols=c(Sunrise:Daylength))

ggplot(Days_df_l8, aes(JDay, value)) +
        geom_line(lwd = 1.5) +
        facet_grid(cols = vars(name)) +
        ylab("Time of Day / Daylength [hours]") +
        xlab("Day of the year [JDay]") +
        theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```


2. Produce an hourly dataset, based on idealized daily curves, for the KA_weather dataset (included in ChillR).

```{r}
# KA_weather
hourtemp_KA <- stack_hourly_temps(KA_weather, latitude=50.4)
```

3. Produce empirical temperature curve parameters for the Winters_hours_gaps dataset, and use them to predict hourly values from daily temperatures (this is very similar to the example above, but please make sure you understand what's going on).

```{r}
empi_curve_l8 <- Empirical_daily_temperature_curve(Winters_hours_gaps)

ggplot(data = empi_curve_l8[1:96, ], aes(Hour, Prediction_coefficient)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1.3, col = "red") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Month)) +
  xlab("Hour of the day") +
  ylab("Prediction coefficient") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

```{r}
coeffs_l8 <- Empirical_daily_temperature_curve(Winters_hours_gaps)
Winters_daily_l8 <- make_all_day_table(Winters_hours_gaps, input_timestep = "hour")
Winter_hours_l8 <- Empirical_hourly_temperatures(Winters_daily_l8, coeffs_l8)


# simplify the data for easier use
Winter_hours_l8 <- Winter_hours_l8[ , c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Temp")]
colnames(Winter_hours_l8)[ncol(Winter_hours_l8)] <- "Temp_empirical"
Winters_ideal_l8 <- stack_hourly_temps(Winters_daily_l8, latitude = 38.5)$hourtemps
Winters_ideal_l8 <- Winters_ideal_l8[ , c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Temp")]
colnames(Winters_ideal_l8)[ncol(Winters_ideal_l8)] <- "Temp_ideal"


# create the "triangular" data set to compare in the end
Winters_triangle_l8 <- Winters_daily_l8
Winters_triangle_l8[ , "Hour"] <- 0
Winters_triangle_l8$Hour[nrow(Winters_triangle_l8)] <- 23
Winters_triangle_l8[ , "Temp"] <- 0
Winters_triangle_l8 <- make_all_day_table(Winters_triangle_l8, timestep = "hour")
colnames(Winters_triangle_l8)[ncol(Winters_triangle_l8)] <- "Temp_triangular"


# the following loop will fill in the daily Tmin and Tmax values for every hour
for (i in 2:nrow(Winters_triangle_l8))
{if (is.na(Winters_triangle_l8$Tmin[i]))
  Winters_triangle_l8$Tmin[i] <- Winters_triangle_l8$Tmin[i - 1]
 if (is.na(Winters_triangle_l8$Tmax[i]))
   Winters_triangle_l8$Tmax[i] <- Winters_triangle_l8$Tmax[i - 1]}

Winters_triangle_l8$Temp_triangular <- NA


# Tmin is fixated to the 6th hour of each day
Winters_triangle_l8$Temp_triangular[which(Winters_triangle_l8$Hour == 6)] <-
  Winters_triangle_l8$Tmin[which(Winters_triangle_l8$Hour == 6)]


# Tmax is fixated to the 18th hour of each day
Winters_triangle_l8$Temp_triangular[which(Winters_triangle_l8$Hour == 18)] <-
  Winters_triangle_l8$Tmax[which(Winters_triangle_l8$Hour == 18)]


# the following loop will fill in the gaps between the min and max data in a linear way
Winters_triangle_l8$Temp_triangular <- interpolate_gaps(Winters_triangle_l8$Temp_triangular)$interp
Winters_triangle_l8 <- Winters_triangle_l8[ , c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Temp_triangular")]


# merge all created data frames for easy display
Winters_temps_l8 <- merge(Winters_hours_gaps, Winter_hours_l8,
                          by = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour"))
Winters_temps_l8 <- merge(Winters_temps_l8, Winters_triangle_l8,
                          by = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour"))

                          by = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour"))


# convert the date into R's date format and reorganize the data frame
Winters_temps_l8[, "DATE"] <-
  ISOdate(Winters_temps_l8$Year,
          Winters_temps_l8$Month,
          Winters_temps_l8$Day,
          Winters_temps_l8$Hour)


Winters_temps_to_plot_l8 <-
  Winters_temps_l8[, c("DATE",
                    "Temp",
                    "Temp_empirical",
                    "Temp_triangular",
                    "Temp_ideal")]
Winters_temps_to_plot_l8 <- Winters_temps_to_plot_l8[100:200, ]
Winters_temps_to_plot_l8 <- pivot_longer(Winters_temps_to_plot_l8, cols=Temp:Temp_ideal)
colnames(Winters_temps_to_plot_l8) <- c("DATE", "Method", "Temperature")


ggplot(data = Winters_temps_to_plot_l8, aes(DATE, Temperature, colour = Method)) +

```

# Some useful tools in R

## Exercises

1. Based on the Winters_hours_gaps data set, use magrittr pipes and functions of the tidyverse to accomplish the following:
    a. Convert the data set into a tibble
    b. Select only the top 10 rows of the data set
    c. Convert the tibble to a long format, with separate rows for Temp_gaps and Temp
    d. Use ggplot2 to plot Temp_gaps and temp as facets (point or line plot)
    e. Convert the data set back to the wide format
    f. Select only the following columns: Year, Month, Day and Temp
    g. Sort the data set by the Temp column, in descending order

```{r}

```

2. For the Winter_hours_gaps data set, write a for loop to convert all temperatures (Temp column) to degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}

```

3. Execute the same operation with a function from the apply family.

```{r}

```

4. Now use the tidyverse function mutate to achieve the same outcome

```{r}

```

5. Voluntary: Consider taking a look at the instruction materials on all these functions, which I linked above as well as at other sources on the internet. There's a lot more to discover here, with lots of potential for making your coding more elegant and easier - and possibly even more fun!

```{r}

```
