# Tree dormancy

## Learning goals

-   Learn about dormancy in temperate fruit trees\
-   Be able to identify the phenological stages of a fruit tree and understand phenology data sets\
-   Describe and compare the two methodologies (empirical and statistical) to identify the chilling and forcing periods of a certain cultivar\

## Introduction into dormancy

Definition dormancy\
\*

Definition phenology\
\*

Dormancy phases\
\* Dormancy establishment\
\* Endo-dormancy\
\* Eco-dormancy\
\* Growth resumption\

Environmental signals\
\* Influence of different latitude to mean temperatures\

Physiological processes that regulate dormancy\
\* Transport\
\* Phytohormones\
\* Genetics\
\* Carbohydrates\

## Dormancy physiology

## Experimental and statistical determination of the chilling and forcing periods

## Phenology record and BBCH scale

What is phenology?\
Phenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycels and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate.\
For example, the changes of a tree through the year and how the change in it's appearance is influenced by biotic (e.g. neigbour plants, insects, birds) and abiotic (for us most important the changing temperature) factors.\
\
Where does the term come from?\
Often are cultural festivals connected to natural happenings, e.g. the blossom of cherries is very important for the Japanese culture.\
Charles Morin\
Botanist who worked on plant phenomena and made great use of the terms "periodical phenomena" and " anthrochronology". He also was the first who used the term phenology. He defined it with the following words: "This is a particular science having the goal to understand the manifestations of life governed by time, it is called phenology.".\
Phenology and climate change\
Phenology is very sensitive to eveen small changes.\

## **Exercises**

1.  Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods?\
    + Because the cultivar is already released there should be official data about the cultivar. Therefore I would use these data to calculate the temperature requirements. As base data I need the long phenological data sets and temperature records. With these I can calculate finally the date of dormancy overcome.\

2.  Which are the advantages (name 2) of the BBCH scale compared with early scales?\
    -   Growth stages are easily recognizable under field conditions.\
    -   Growth stages are graded in the order of apperance.
3.  Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:\
    The pictures are described from left to right.\
    All of the classifications are based on the given pictures and I assume that the image section shown corresponds to the most represented of the tree.\

-   picture 1: BBCH-stage 57\
    -   Main stage: 50, reproductive development or influence emergence\
    -   stage 57: Sepals open (59 would be ballooning, but the petals are too compact for this stage)\
-   picture 2: BBCH-stage 65\
    -   Main stage 60: Flowering\
    -   stage 65: Full flowering, at least 50 % of the flowers are open, the first petals are already falling.\
-   picture 3: BBCH-stage: 86\
    -   Main stage 80: ripening or maturity\
    + stage 85: Coloring advanced (The color is too light to be ripe but is clearly advanced).\

# Climate change and impact projection

## The drivers of climate change

## What we've already seen

## Future scenarios

## Impact projection approaches

## **Exercises**

1.  List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.\

2.  Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.\

3.  What does the abbreviation 'RCP' stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?\

4.  Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.\
