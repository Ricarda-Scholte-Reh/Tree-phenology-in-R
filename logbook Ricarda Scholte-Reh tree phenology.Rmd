# Tree dormancy

## Learning goals

-   Learn about dormancy in temperate fruit trees\
-   Be able to identify the phenological stages of a fruit tree and understand phenology data sets\
-   Describe and compare the two methodologies (empirical and statistical) to identify the chilling and forcing periods of a certain cultivar\

## Introduction into dormancy

Definition phenology\
- The study of natural phenomena that recur periodically in plants and animals\
- It also studies the relationship of these phenomena to seasonal changes ans climates\
- More simply spoken is phenology the study of annual sequence of plant development\
[Source: ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phenology)\

Definition dormancy\
- The stage in which a plant is alive but not actively growing\
- Is important to survive unfavorable conditions like freezing (mainly in winter)\
- To end the first stage of dormancy a certain amount of cool temperature is required.\
- 4 phases\
- Dormancy establishment\
- The tree stops growing and it's leaf fall in autumn\
- Is mostly regulated by temperature and photoperiod\
- The photoperiod varies depending on the latitude which also influences it's importance\
- Endo-dormancy\
- Controlled by plant endogenous factors\
- In this stage is the tree not able to grow (even if the environment has perfect conditions)\
- A certain time of chilling is required to overcome this stage.\
- As soon as the plant did overcome this stage it is able again to respond to growth promoting environmental signals\
- Eco-dormancy\
- In this stage the dormance is already broken, but the plant does not start to grow right away\
- The bats do have now the capacity to grow and are still able to resist freezing temperatures but on the "outside" nothing happens.\
- The reason that nothing happens are not unsuitable environmental conditions for growing\
- In this stage is the temperature the most important factor\
- Growth resumption\
- Here are the first changes optically observable\
- The begin of this stage depends heavily on the species and cultivar\
- Now are the buds more sensitive to freezing temperatures\
- Inside of the buds does now begin the development of the reproductive organs\

Physiological processes that regulate dormancy\
Dormancy is the result of complex interactions between numerous physiological processes that occurs in different parts of the tree (e.g. buds, meristems and vascular tissue).\
- Transport\
- During dormancy does the transport of water and nutrients stops in the whole plant but also at cellular level\
- Phytohormones\
- Are long distance signaling compounds acting in very long concentrations\
- They regulate plant-growth and development\
- They mediate responses to biotic and abiotic stressors\
- Genetics\
- The length and requirements for dormancy are also linked to certain "dormancy-associated mudbox" genes\
- This group of genes was identified and related to dormancy thanks to the ever-growing pits mutant (a mutant that did grow all around the year)\
- Recently transcriptomic studies have shown global changes in expression patterns of genes associated with a broad range of structural and physiological functions during dormancy progression\
- Carbohydrates\
- Nanostructural carbohydrate dynamics has a family assigned critical roles in tree dormancy. Trees exhibit a strong fluctuation between dormance stages in a rate at which soluble sugars and starch are synthetzied and degraded\
- Nanostructural carbohydrates have three main functions\
- energy esterates\
- transport and supply\
- osmotic regulation and signaling\
- These functions clearly varied within and between seasons\

## Dormancy physiology

## Experimental and statistical determination of the chilling and forcing periods

## Phenology record and BBCH scale

What is phenology?\
Phenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycels and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate.\
For example, the changes of a tree through the year and how the change in it's appearance is influenced by biotic (e.g. neigbour plants, insects, birds) and abiotic (for us most important the changing temperature) factors.\
\
Where does the term come from?\
Often are cultural festivals connected to natural happenings, e.g. the blossom of cherries is very important for the Japanese culture.\
Charles Morin\
Botanist who worked on plant phenomena and made great use of the terms "periodical phenomena" and " anthrochronology". He also was the first who used the term phenology. He defined it with the following words: "This is a particular science having the goal to understand the manifestations of life governed by time, it is called phenology.".\
Phenology and climate change\
Phenology is very sensitive to eveen small changes.\

## Exercises

1.  Put yourself in the place of a breeder who wants to calculate the temperature requirements of a newly released cultivar. Which method will you use to calculate the chilling and forcing periods?\
    -   Because the cultivar is already released there should be official data about the cultivar. Therefore I would use these data to calculate the temperature requirements. As base data I need the long phenological data sets and temperature records. With these I can calculate finally the date of dormancy overcome.\
2.  Which are the advantages (name 2) of the BBCH scale compared with early scales?\
    -   Growth stages are easily recognizable under field conditions.\
    -   Growth stages are graded in the order of apperance.
3.  Classify the following phenological stages of sweet cherry according to the BBCH scale:\
    The pictures are described from left to right. All of the classifications are based on the given pictures and I assume that the image section shown corresponds to the most represented of the tree.\

-   picture 1: BBCH-stage 57\
    -   Main stage: 50, reproductive development or influence emergence\
    -   stage 57: Sepals open (59 would be ballooning, but the petals are too compact for this stage)\
-   picture 2: BBCH-stage 65\
    -   Main stage 60: Flowering\
    -   stage 65: Full flowering, at least 50 % of the flowers are open, the first petals are already falling.\
-   picture 3: BBCH-stage: 86\
    -   Main stage 80: ripening or maturity\
    -   stage 85: Coloring advanced (The color is too light to be ripe but is clearly advanced).\

# Climate change and impact projection

## The drivers of climate change

## What we've already seen

## Future scenarios

## Impact projection approaches

## Exercises

1.  List the main drivers of climate change at the decade to century scale, and briefly explain the mechanism through which the currently most important driver affects our climate.\

-   Sun
    -   Warms Earth through solar radiation
    -   Activity varies slightly (cyclically) over time, as evidenced by sunspots
    -   Differences in energy that reaches Earth are small
    -   Explains only a small fraction of current climate variability
    -   Important driver of climate change on geological timescales, but not of recent climate change
-   Aerosols
    -   Suspensions of liquid, solid, or mixed particles with highly variable chemical composition and size distribution
    -   Natural sources: Sea salt, dust, volcanic eruptions, fires
    -   Anthropogenic sources: combustion processes (e.g. power plants, cars, fires and cook stoves)
    -   Generally have a cooling effect on the climate, especially locally
    -   Human aerosol emissions are a major climate driver in some places
    -   Global aerosol distribution â€“ fraction of Aerosol Optical Depth related to human emissions
    -   Major climate driver in industrial centers
-   Clouds
    -   Can have both cooling and warming effects
    -   Net effect likely important but poorly understood
    -   Positive feedback with warming possible: warmer -\> more clouds -\> warmer -\> more evaporation -\> more clouds
-   Ozone
    -   Surface (tropospheric) ozone: constituent of smog, health hazard (bad ozone)
    -   Stratospheric ozone (10-35 km above surface): shields Earth from UV-B radiation (good ozone)
    -   Greenhouse gas: presence in the stratosphere has a warming effect
    -   Destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
-   Surface albedo
    -   Reflection of radiation by the land surface
    -   Light surfaces (e.g. ice, snow) reflect almost all radiation, dark surfaces (ocean, dark soil, forest) very little
    -   Land cover change can affect albedo
-   Greenhouse gases
    -   Atmospheric gases that trap heat on Earth
    -   Can absorb only radiation of certain wavelengths
    -   Short-wave radiation from the sun passes
    -   Long-wave radiation from Earth surface is absorbed
    -   Greenhouse effects warms the planet
-   Long-term drivers
    -   Trends in solar activity
        -   Star life cycle, gradually decreasing luminosity over billions of years
    -   Ocean currents/continent constellations
        -   Global heat transfer (Gulf Stream, Antarctic Circumpolar Current; millions of years)
    -   Plants vs. animals (hypothetical)
        -   Balance of CO2 production and consumption
        -   Back and forth between â€˜Snowball Earthâ€™ and â€˜Greenhouse Earthâ€™
    -   Volcanic and meteorite activity
        -   Volcanoes emit CO2 (warming) and dust (cooling) ; supervolcanoes caused massive effects
        -   Meteorite impacts can raise dust concentrations for years
    -   Trends in solar activity
        -   Star life cycle, gradually decreasing luminosity over billions of years
    -   Ocean currents/continent constellations
        -   Global heat transfer (Gulf Stream, Antarctic Circumpolar Current; millions of years)
    -   Plants vs. animals (hypothetical)
        -   Balance of CO2 production and consumption
        -   Back and forth between â€˜Snowball Earthâ€™ and â€˜Greenhouse Earthâ€™
    -   Volcanic and meteorite activity
        -   Volcanoes emit CO2 (warming) and dust (cooling) ; supervolcanoes caused massive effects
        -   Meteorite impacts can raise dust concentrations for years
    -   Milankovic cycles
        -   Variation in Earthâ€™s orbit: eccentricity, axial tilt and precession (19,000 to 400,000-year cycles)
        -   Most likely cause of Ice Ages

2.  Explain briefly what is special about temperature dynamics of recent decades, and why we have good reasons to be concerned.\

-   Recently the mean temperatures are globally rising clearly and very drastically
-   Especially in the last 50 to 100 years
-   this an other facors have a great influence in our climate and weather (regional and global)
-   we will and already do experience more extreme weather (like more dry periods, extreme rain, mild and extreme winter)
-   most important is the rapid warming (as conclusion)

3.  What does the abbreviation 'RCP' stand for, how are RCPs defined, and what is their role in projecting future climates?\

-   RCP -\> Representative Concentration Pathways
-   RCPs project future greenhouse gas concentrations (NOT emissions) based on different climate change scenarios until the year 2100
-   the different scenarios are labeled after the possible radiative forcing values in the year 2100

4.  Briefly describe the 4 climate impact projection methods described in the fourth video.\

-   statistical models
-   species distribution modeling
-   process-based models
-   climate analouge analysis
